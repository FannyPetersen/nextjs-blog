1. https://dev.to/chrsgrrtt/easy-user-authentication-with-next-js-18oe - tutorial for authentication

then
3. 
https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction - how to use api-routes in next.js
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/api-routes-rest/pages/api/user/%5Bid%5D.js - example using REST API in next.js
https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/ - in here in the documentation is info on how to access contentfuls content management API
